        <h2>The Legend of Zelda NES remake: </h2>
        <p>I worked on Link's mechanics (movement, attack, weapons), the level design/enemy placement,
            as well as a few enemies (wallmaster, bladetraps).
            I also worked on the custom level design and dash mechanic, and a portion of the audio and visuals.
            
            The project was done using Unity in C#.

        <h2>Orbital Mechanics: </h2>
        <p>I made an original puzzle platforming physics game that uses real orbital mechanics in a fun way.
            If you want to gain an intuitive understanding of orbital mechanics that even the Gemini 4 spaceflight team hadn't
            figured out, play this game!

        <h2>Kai: Lost Waters</h2>
        <p>I helped make an original 2d puzzle platformer with dynamic water. I did the water physics and interactions, player
            abilities, and the visuals of the water interactables. I also contributed significantly to the level design and other gameplay mechanics.
            I also did the audio and sound effects.
