        <h2>The Legend of Zelda NES remake: </h2>
        <p>I worked on Link's mechanics (movement, attack, weapons), the level design/enemy placement,
            as well as a few enemies (wallmaster, bladetraps).
            I also worked on the custom level design and dash mechanic, and a portion of the audio and visuals.
            
            The project was done using Unity in C#.

        <h2>Orbital Mechanics: </h2>
        <p>I made an original puzzle platforming physics game that uses real orbital mechanics in a fun way.
            If you want to gain an intuitive understanding of orbital mechanics that even the Gemini 4 spaceflight team hadn't
            figured out, play this game!

        <h2>Kai: Lost Waters</h2>
        <p>I helped make an original 2d puzzle platformer with dynamic water. I made the physics/mechanics, visuals and audio
            of <ul>
                <li>the water and its interactions including water spawners, vaporizing to steam, evaporating, glowing, etc</li>
                <li>the water abilities including the bending (left click) and blast (right click)</li>
                <li>the stone sliding doors/platforms, attached wires, and droplet "buttons"</li>
                <li>the springy capsule-shaped glowing platforms</li>
                <li>the raising water platforms</li>
                </ul>
            with the exception of the sprites for the sliding door and capsule-shaped platforms, and half the sprite of the raising platforms.

            Other contributions include:
            <ul>
            <li>All the audio was also done by me with the exception of the menu click sounds.</li>
            <li>I also did the visuals (flame) and audio of the gecko enemies (and the death), with the exception of the sprite and its animation</li>
            <li>I was a core level and puzzle designer, and contributed to other gameplay mechanics including the thorns and logs</li>
            <li>The starting and ending cutscenes were also strung together by me, and I drew the first shot of the ending cutscene.</li>
            </ul>
