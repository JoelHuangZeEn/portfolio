        <h2>The Legend of Zelda NES remake: </h2>
        <p>I worked on Link's mechanics (movement, attack, weapons), the level design/enemy placement,
            as well as a few enemies (wallmaster, bladetraps).
            I also worked on the custom level design and dash mechanic, and a portion of the audio and visuals.
            
            The project was done using Unity in C#.
